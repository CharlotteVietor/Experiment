# Simulation

What I plan to put here:
- The simulation code with which the simulation worked on 23-03
- The file for data generation in which A, B, q and r are derived from lognormal distributions
- The file in which the optimal B is generated by using the Kalman Gain, and that this B is also estimated by using Kalman
- The file in which we try to estimate A, B, q and r based on only y(n), and not based on ximp(n) and xexp(n)
- The file in which 2 baseline blocks are added to see whether this helps to estimate q and r more accurately
- The file of BayesianStateSpaceFit in which we use hyperparameters and precisions again instead of directly normal distributions
